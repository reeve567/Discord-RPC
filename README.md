# Discord RPC Tool

Just a simple tool made with Kotlin to change your status using the [Discord RPC](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc).

In order to use the tool, you must go into the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers) and sign into your account.  Once you do that, you need to create an application.  The Client ID is what you need for the "Application Key" *which I'm realizing is a pretty bad name on my part*.

The name of your application will be what is displayed next to 'Playing' on Discord, and this can be changed as much as you like, though you'll need to press save again after you change the name in order for the new name to take effect.

The "Details" part is the first line in the menu, under the name.

The part under that is the "State", and the "Large Image Text" shows when you hover over the image.  The "Large Image Key" refers to the name of the image in the Discord Developer Portal.

This is under "Rich Presence" in the application, then under "Art Assets".
